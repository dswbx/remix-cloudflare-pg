# Remix Cloudflare PG issue
Unsuccessful attempt to get remix on cloudflare running with PG, although PG should be now supported by cloudflare worker environments. I've confirmed, that it works with cloudflare workers directly.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Pull this repo
2. Run `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
3. Adjust Postgres connection string at `src/routes/api/test.ts` to point to your database
4. Run dev server with `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`)
5. Access route at `http://localhost:3000/api/test`

Note the console output, which looks somewhat like:

```
> remix dev --manual -c "npm run start"

The start command `pn start` should already include `node-compat`:
```
wrangler pages dev --compatibility-date=2023-06-21 --node-compat ./public
```

It seems to be a build problem, as when you run wrangler dev command directly, the server starts (but not with the new code obviously):
```
wrangler pages dev --compatibility-date=2023-06-21 --node-compat ./public
```
